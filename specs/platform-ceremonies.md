# Identity-platform ceremonies

Part of the [libID protocol specification](libid.md).

## 1. Scope

This document is the normative owner of each platform's OAuth profile,
authenticated identity fields, evidence composition, proof-validity rule,
token exchange, and platform-specific failure behavior. The
[common ceremony rules](ceremony-common.md) own the Authorization Digest,
serialization, PKCE, transcript extraction, client binding, and evidence
time. The Consumer's protocol owns transaction dispatch and authorization.
The browser architecture owns browsing contexts, redirect transport,
interruption behavior, and application handoff.

Google returns a signed OIDC ID Token directly to the redirect fragment. X and
GitHub use the OAuth authorization-code flow and notarized transcripts of
authenticated platform API responses.

Terms are imported from
[common ceremony rules §2](ceremony-common.md#2-terminology).

## 2. Ceremony profiles

Each platform ceremony has an independently versioned immutable profile. Its
Platform Ceremony Version is carried in its Authorization Digest and in the
Submission Payload. Each platform section defines its own launch version. A
version covers the digest, OAuth construction, and platform-specific proof
statement, not any Consumer Chain's verifier implementation. A Consumer Chain
routes on its own Verifier Version (common §5.1).

A profile is selected by the pair `(identityPlatform,
platformCeremonyVersion)`. Each platform section defines its exact canonical
lowercase ASCII `identityPlatform`; the version is a separate integer and is
never appended to that string.

Each profile also fixes the attestation list of common REQ-COMMON-41 and the
digest-binding method of common REQ-COMMON-02C. Google verifies no attestation
and binds the digest as a public proof input; X and GitHub each verify two
attestations — a token or token-exchange session and an identity session — and
bind the digest through the revealed `code_verifier` of common
REQ-COMMON-15A.

- REQ-PLAT-01:
  The Canonical Runtime MUST select and retain one exact profile for the live
  ceremony. The Canonical Runtime MUST NOT substitute another profile after
  authorization starts. Necessity: changing profiles mid-ceremony would produce
  evidence the selected verifier cannot check.
- REQ-PLAT-01A (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  Each Platform Ceremony Version MUST identify one exact proof statement and
  set of semantic public inputs independently of any Platform Verifier artifact
  or Notary Service deployment. Before accepting that platform and version
  pair, the Verifier Governance Process MUST select a conforming Platform
  Verifier artifact and, for a TLSNotary profile, a compatible Notary Service.
  Necessity: chain artifacts implement the versioned ceremony boundary; they
  do not define it.
- REQ-PLAT-01B:
  The Canonical Runtime MUST identify a profile with the exact
  `(identityPlatform, platformCeremonyVersion)` pair its platform section
  defines. It MUST NOT append the version to `identityPlatform` or accept a
  presentation alias in its place. Necessity: every component that selects a
  profile must do so on one canonical pair. A Consumer Chain's Verifier
  Version selects an implementation of a profile, not the profile.
- REQ-PLAT-02:
  The Canonical Runtime MUST treat a profile as ineligible until the
  application's authenticated profile lists it and the generated deployment
  contains every fixed route it requires. Necessity: cross-component
  interoperability between the Canonical Runtime build and server deployment.
- REQ-PLAT-03 (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST derive the local identity fields exclusively from
  the Platform Profile's canonical source in the exact Submission it
  returns.
  Those fields are not an authority decision; only the Consumer's
  acceptance of that exact Submission is. For X and GitHub, the Canonical Runtime MUST parse the exact revealed identity-response bytes that the
  Platform Verifier extracts, using the same canonical extraction and
  normalization rules. The Canonical Runtime MUST reject a detached proof
  output, sidecar value, or caller value that supplies or overrides `userId`,
  handle, or `metadataObservedAt`.

This is a data-source invariant, not a browser-flow requirement. It defines
the identity fields returned to callers and used by any composition-owned UI;
it does not create a ceremony-owned confirmation page.

### 2.1 Canonical platform user identifiers

| Identity platform | Authenticated source | Canonical `userId` | Mutable handle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google | signed ID-Token `sub` | its exact 1–255 case-sensitive ASCII bytes | normalized email |
| X | `/2/users/me.data.id` JSON string | canonical nonzero unsigned 64-bit decimal | normalized `username` |
| GitHub | `/user.id` JSON integer token | canonical nonzero unsigned 64-bit decimal | normalized `login` |

- REQ-PLAT-04:
  The Implementation MUST accept a Google `sub` of bytes `0x20` through `0x7e`
  only. The Implementation MUST reject empty, control, non-ASCII, and
  over-255-byte values. Necessity: identity compatibility across
  implementations.
- REQ-PLAT-05:
  The Implementation MUST NOT trim or case-convert a Google `sub`. Necessity:
  identity compatibility.
- REQ-PLAT-06:
  The Implementation MUST require an X or GitHub identifier to match
  `^[1-9][0-9]{0,19}$` with a numeric value at most `2^64 - 1`. Necessity:
  identity compatibility.
- REQ-PLAT-07:
  The Implementation MUST copy the GitHub raw JSON number token's decimal bytes
  as the string. The Implementation MUST NOT parse it through a floating-point
  number, accept exponent notation, or round it. Necessity: identity
  compatibility.
- REQ-PLAT-08:
  The Implementation MUST reject a quoted GitHub identifier, a numeric X
  identifier, a leading zero, a sign, a fraction, an exponent, and any
  normalization of a Google `sub`. Necessity: identity compatibility.

Conformance vectors:

| Platform | Authenticated input | `userId` |
|---|---|---|
| Google | `sub: "123456789012345678901"` | `123456789012345678901` |
| X | `"id":"2244994945"` | `2244994945` |
| GitHub | `"id":1` | `1` |

Email, audience, client identifier, X username, and GitHub login never
replace the immutable `userId`.

### 2.1a Handle normalization

Proof layers work with raw bytes; normalization is a consumption-time
derivation, layered strictly:

- REQ-PLAT-08A (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Proving Circuit and the Notary Service MUST NOT case-fold, trim, or
  otherwise transform identity bytes. The Consumer MUST receive the handle as
  the raw authenticated bytes of its platform source.
- REQ-PLAT-08B (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Consumer MUST derive the normalized handle from the
  proof-verified raw bytes on its own write path. The Consumer MUST
  NOT accept a caller-supplied normalized handle or pre-hashed handle key.
  Necessity: the handle arrives inside a proof; a caller supplying the
  derived key could name any handle it liked.
- REQ-PLAT-08C:
  A browser-side normalization exists only for display and local checks. No
  proof statement or Consumer behavior may rely on it. Necessity: a check
  running in software the prover chooses whether to run is not a defense.

Normalization applies these per-platform criteria: ASCII-only input with
disallowed bytes rejected; lowercasing; Google validates the value as an
email address and keeps its `@`; X and GitHub strip one leading `@`;
underscore is allowed on X and not on GitHub; hyphen is allowed on GitHub and
not on X, and never leading, trailing, or doubled; a per-platform maximum
length; an empty result is rejected. The exact byte-level algorithm is fixed
by the shared cross-language handle vector table this profile publishes
alongside the specification, which every implementation reproduces; that
table, not this prose, is the precision anchor. A profile that publishes no
such table is ineligible.

- TEST-PLAT-20 (exercises REQ-PLAT-08A, REQ-PLAT-08B, REQ-PLAT-08C):
  Every implementation reproduces the shared handle vector table byte for
  byte; a caller-supplied normalized handle or pre-hashed key is rejected;
  and identity bytes transformed before derivation by the Consumer
  fail conformance.

### 2.2 Metadata ordering and validity ceilings

Proof validity and mutable-metadata ordering use the authenticated times below.

| Identity platform | `metadataObservedAt` | `proofValidUntil` |
|---|---|---|
| Google | signed ID-Token `exp` | signed ID-Token `exp` |
| X | the token attestation's signed creation time | `metadataObservedAt + proofLifetime[x]` |
| GitHub | the token-exchange attestation's signed creation time | `metadataObservedAt + proofLifetime[github]` |

For X and GitHub, "timestamp" is the signed TLSNotary attestation creation
time. The token attestation is the one-time PKCE and Authorization Digest
binding, so it alone supplies evidence time: one signed timestamp anchors both metadata
ordering and proof validity, exactly as Google's single signed `exp` does.
The identity attestation opens the same bearer and carries the identity
fields; its own creation time is not an evidence-time input and does not
refresh the authorization. The named lifetimes are current
[protocol parameters](libid.md#protocol-parameters).

Google's signed `exp` already supplies the accepted one-hour ordering and
validity value. A Google proof also requires its signing modulus to remain in
the Platform Verifier's active set. The Authorization Digest carries no expiration.
`metadataObservedAt` is the monotone metadata watermark of common
REQ-COMMON-25A. Older evidence cannot regress stored metadata and does not
block an otherwise valid authority operation.

- REQ-PLAT-09 (upholds SP-FRESH-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST reject an X or GitHub attestation timestamp more than
  `maxFutureAttestationSkew` ahead of Block Time.
- REQ-PLAT-09A (upholds SP-FRESH-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST derive `metadataObservedAt` and
  `proofValidUntil` from the exact sources in the table above and from
  nothing else.

## 3. Google OIDC ceremony

```text
identityPlatform = "google"
platformCeremonyVersion = 1
```

Google uses direct authentication-only OIDC and has no server-side token
exchange. Identity evidence is the signed ID Token delivered in the redirect
fragment.

### 3.1 Authorization request

`GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`, serialized per
[common §6](ceremony-common.md#6-canonical-oauth-serialization):

| Order | Field | Exact value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `response_type` | `id_token` |
| 2 | `response_mode` | `fragment` |
| 3 | `client_id` | configured client identifier |
| 4 | `redirect_uri` | immutable redirect URI |
| 5 | `scope` | `openid email` |
| 6 | `state` | immutable one-use OAuth state |
| 7 | `nonce` | `BASE64URL_NOPAD(authorizationDigest)` |

The authorization request is plain browser navigation and is never
notarized; no proof semantics attach to any field above. The table is
operational guidance for obtaining a token whose signed claims satisfy
§3.2–§3.3. The signed ID Token is the only Google evidence.

- REQ-PLAT-10 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST set `nonce` to the base64url encoding of the 32
  Authorization Digest bytes, not to hexadecimal text.
- REQ-PLAT-11 (upholds SP-DELIVERY-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST request only `response_type=id_token` with
  `response_mode=fragment`. The Canonical Runtime MUST NOT request an
  authorization code or access token. Necessity: the signed identity evidence
  reaches the local Redirect Runtime without introducing a confidential
  backend or bearer capability.
- REQ-PLAT-12 (upholds SP-DELIVERY-01):
  The Redirect Runtime MUST copy the bounded query and fragment into memory and
  clear both before storage or network access. The Canonical Runtime MUST require
  an empty query and a fragment carrying exactly one `state` plus exactly one
  `id_token` XOR `error`. The Canonical Runtime MUST reject duplicate, additional
  authoritative, mixed-transport, or malformed fields and MUST ignore
  diagnostic fields.
- REQ-PLAT-13 (upholds SP-DELIVERY-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST match `state` to exactly one live local ceremony
  and consume it once before accepting the ID Token. No server-side state or
  prepare request participates in this lookup.

Conformance vector, for the Authorization Digest of
[common §5](ceremony-common.md#5-authorization-digest):

```text
authorizationDigest = 0xb318fb559e16a179b853ed2853576cda16032d93b0839bb81a55135d334c0af5
Google nonce         = sxj7VZ4WoXm4U-0oU1ds2hYDLZOwg5u4GlUTXTNMCvU
```

### 3.2 Local token verification

- REQ-PLAT-14 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST reject an ID Token whose `nonce` differs from the
  Authorization Digest it constructed.
- REQ-PLAT-15:
  The Canonical Runtime MUST reject a Google response carrying `code` or
  `access_token`. Necessity: neither artifact belongs to this
  authentication-only profile.

### 3.3 Proof statement

The Proving Circuit and Consumer enforce all of the following:

- REQ-PLAT-16 (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST hash the exact ASCII
  `BASE64URL_NOPAD(header) || "." || BASE64URL_NOPAD(payload)` bytes with
  SHA-256. The Proving Circuit MUST verify the signature as
  RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 under the exact RSA modulus `n` and the profile-fixed
  exponent `e = 65537`. The Proving Circuit MUST decode the claims checked
  below from that signed payload, not from a detached copy.

The profile fixes RS256; the circuit performs no algorithm dispatch and does
not parse the protected header. A token signed under any other algorithm or
key simply fails the fixed verification relation. Algorithm-confusion attacks
require a verifier that dispatches on the header `alg`; none exists here.

- REQ-PLAT-16A (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST expose the exact RSA modulus used for REQ-PLAT-16
  as a public proof input. Its internal field or limb representation belongs to
  the proving and verifier artifacts, not the Platform Profile.
  The Proving Circuit MUST NOT decide trusted-set membership or take the active
  set as an input. The Platform Verifier alone checks the modulus under
  REQ-PLAT-23. JWK decoding and canonical-encoding validation happen where a
  modulus is admitted to the trusted set, per REQ-PLAT-24; the JWK encoding
  appears in no signed artifact, so proving it would add nothing.
- REQ-PLAT-16B (upholds SP-BIND-01, SP-CLIENT-01, SP-FRESH-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST expose exactly the following Google public inputs,
  each derived from the signed payload or verified signing key:

  | Public input | Authenticated source |
  |---|---|
  | Authorization Digest | signed `nonce`, decoded as exactly 32 bytes |
  | client-identifier digest | `SHA256` of the signed `aud` |
  | canonical `userId` | signed `sub` |
  | raw `email` bytes | signed `email`; the Consumer derives the normalized handle |
  | evidence timestamp | signed `exp`; used for both `metadataObservedAt` and `proofValidUntil` |
  | RSA modulus | exact `n` that verified the JWS; `e = 65537` is profile-fixed |

  The Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose a detached second representation of a
  claim. Proofs are over raw bytes; normalization, such as lowercasing the
  handle, is the Consumer's decision at consumption time.
- REQ-PLAT-17 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST prove the signed `iss` equals
  `https://accounts.google.com`.
- REQ-PLAT-18 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST prove `nonce` equals the Authorization Digest.
- REQ-PLAT-19 (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST expose `SHA256` of the signed `aud` as the
  client-binding public input.
- REQ-PLAT-19A (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST require `SHA256` of the `aud` bytes carried in
  the Submission to equal that public input. The Platform Verifier MUST return those bytes
  as the client identifier of common REQ-COMMON-16. Necessity: the digest authenticates the
  bytes without the circuit packing a variable-length string into public
  inputs, and the Consumer still receives the readable value. Admission stays
  permissionless per common REQ-COMMON-17C.
- REQ-PLAT-20:
  The Proving Circuit MUST prove `email_verified` is the boolean `true`.
  Necessity: an unverified email would let one account assert another party's
  address as its handle.
- REQ-PLAT-21 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The prover supplies the offset of each checked claim as a private input.
  The Proving Circuit MUST check the string claims `iss`, `sub`, `aud`,
  `nonce`, and `email` under common REQ-COMMON-19 and REQ-COMMON-19B. The
  Proving Circuit MUST check `exp` as a canonical unsigned JSON integer bounded
  by an unsigned 64-bit integer, and `email_verified` as the exact unquoted
  JSON boolean `true`,
  under common REQ-COMMON-19D.
  Duplicate-free top-level structure is the issuer's behavior under
  ASM-PROV-06; the circuit performs no search and no duplicate scan.
- REQ-PLAT-22 (upholds SP-FRESH-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST reject a proof whose signed `exp` places
  `proofValidUntil` at or before Block Time.

The signing key is fetched from Google's JWKS endpoint as witness input.

- REQ-PLAT-23 (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST reject a proof whose RSA modulus is absent from
  the Platform Verifier's active trusted Google modulus set.
- REQ-PLAT-24:
  The Verifier Governance Process MUST add a newly published Google signing
  modulus to the trusted set before Google signs with it in production.
  Necessity: Google rotates signing keys on the order of weekly, so every
  Google ceremony fails closed while an active modulus is untrusted.

## 4. Browser TLSNotary launch transport

Launch fixes X's `/2/oauth2/token` and `/2/users/me` sessions and GitHub's
`/user` session to the Proxy profile.

| Property | Proxy profile | Browser MPC profile |
|---|---|---|
| Platform connection | notary connects to the pinned platform endpoint | deployment module supplies an encrypted WebSocket-to-TCP bridge |
| Platform sees | notary egress | application redirect-origin egress |
| Deployment sees OAuth plaintext | no | no |
| Soundness | notary-to-platform path must not be adversarial | survives an adversarial byte bridge |
| Cost | lower bandwidth, latency, rounds | higher browser and deployment cost |

- REQ-PLAT-25 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST discard every partial transcript and TLS state before
  retrying a notarized request.
- REQ-PLAT-26 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST NOT use application-controlled platform egress in the
  launch profile, because the prover holds the session keys and
  prover-egress collusion could inject authenticated server-direction records.
- REQ-PLAT-27 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST NOT let an application, user, request, browser
  probe, failure, or retry select Browser MPC or switch transport within a
  launch ceremony.
- REQ-PLAT-28 (upholds SP-DELIVERY-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST require the X or GitHub authorization redirect to
  carry an empty fragment and a query containing exactly one `state` plus
  exactly one `code` XOR `error`. The Canonical Runtime MUST reject duplicate,
  mixed-transport, additional
  authoritative, and malformed fields. The single accepted `code` is the code
  consumed at redirect ingress that REQ-PLAT-29 and REQ-PLAT-46 compare
  against.
- REQ-PLAT-28A (upholds SP-DELIVERY-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST match the redirect's `state` to exactly one live
  local ceremony and consume it once before starting the token request. No
  server-side state or prepare request participates in this lookup.
  Necessity: the redirect is the only point where the ceremony that requested
  the authorization can still be identified.

Browser MPC is a deferred protocol alternative. It may remove the
notary-to-platform path assumption and notary egress exposure, but it requires
qualification of browser bandwidth, latency, memory, battery,
WebSocket-to-TCP bridging, and mobile suspension. Adopting it requires a new
ceremony profile whenever it changes the proof statement, attestation format,
ceremony behavior, or security assumptions; it is not deployment configuration
under the X or GitHub profile.

## 5. X ceremony

```text
identityPlatform = "x"
platformCeremonyVersion = 1
```

X uses a public client with S256 PKCE and two browser-owned TLSNotary
sessions.

### 5.1 Authorization request

`GET https://x.com/i/oauth2/authorize`:

| Order | Field | Exact value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `response_type` | `code` |
| 2 | `client_id` | configured client identifier |
| 3 | `redirect_uri` | immutable redirect URI |
| 4 | `scope` | `tweet.read users.read` |
| 5 | `state` | immutable one-use OAuth state |
| 6 | `code_challenge` | PKCE challenge per common §7 |
| 7 | `code_challenge_method` | `S256` |

### 5.2 Token request

`POST https://api.x.com/2/oauth2/token`, media type
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `Accept: application/json`:

| Order | Field | Exact value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `grant_type` | `authorization_code` |
| 2 | `client_id` | configured client identifier |
| 3 | `code` | consumed redirect code |
| 4 | `redirect_uri` | immutable redirect URI |
| 5 | `code_verifier` | PKCE verifier per common §7 |

- REQ-PLAT-29 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the token request's `code` range. The
  Canonical Runtime MUST require that revealed serialized value to equal the
  canonical form serialization of the code consumed at redirect ingress,
  byte for byte, under common REQ-COMMON-07.
- REQ-PLAT-30 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST constrain the opened bearer range to nonempty
  printable ASCII of at most 4096 bytes. The carriage-return and line-feed
  exclusion of common REQ-COMMON-37 applies to this range, because the
  identity session sends it inside a header. Necessity: the range is opened
  to link two attestations, so it needs a bound and a charset; the circuit
  verifies no other property of the token response.

The request is one revealed range: the request line, every header and the
body. The rows below name what the Platform Verifier reads out of it, not
separate ranges; the attested record carries adjacent revealed ranges as one,
so a plan of one range per field would not survive signing.

Per common §9, the token session reveals exactly these ranges; every other
byte stays behind a charset-constrained range commitment of the pinned
attestation format:

| Range | Revealed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| the request line and every request header | yes | the Platform Verifier compares the method and path with its profile constants, requires `host` and the media type that selects the parser the platform applied to the body rows beneath this one (common REQ-COMMON-21B), and refuses the headers REQ-PLAT-56A forbids |
| endpoint authority | not a range | the Notary Service authenticated the TLS server identity, and the Platform Verifier compares the attested authority against its pinned constant per common REQ-COMMON-21A |
| `grant_type` | yes | constant `authorization_code`; the Platform Verifier compares it byte for byte per REQ-PLAT-56 |
| `client_id` | yes | the Platform Verifier reads and returns it |
| `code` | yes | compared to the code consumed at redirect ingress |
| `redirect_uri` | yes | the Canonical Runtime compares its immutable profile; no chain or circuit value |
| `code_verifier` | yes | the Platform Verifier recomputes it from the digest and `authorizationNonce` per common REQ-COMMON-15A |
| attestation timestamp | not a range | the attestation's own signed creation time, which derives the authenticated validity ceiling per §2.2 |
| `"access_token":"` and the closing quote immediately around the bearer value | yes | anchor the committed bearer range as that field's value, per common REQ-COMMON-18A |
| bearer range | committed | a blinded commitment, opened only in circuit |
| everything else | no | the response status line and headers, `scope`, `token_type`, other response fields |

Neither the authority nor the attestation timestamp is a transcript range.
The authority reaches the Platform Verifier as
the TLS server identity the Notary Service authenticated under common
REQ-COMMON-21, carried in the attested data: the transcript
holds the authority only in a `host` header, which the first row reveals and
REQ-PLAT-56A holds to the pinned authority, and that header is
prover-composed text that says nothing about which server answered. The
timestamp is the signed creation time of the attested data itself, which is why common REQ-COMMON-25 can forbid inferring it from a
response header. The two delimiter reveals are what anchor the committed range in the
received direction, which would otherwise reveal no byte at all and leave that
range indistinguishable from a `refresh_token` value.

Those reveals and the in-circuit `code_verifier` opening of REQ-COMMON-15
reduce the hidden request surface, but revealing a range does not reject a form
delimiter inside it. The X profile therefore retains ASM-PROV-07 as a soundness
dependency.

- REQ-PLAT-29A (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the `client_id` range of the token request in
  the notarized session.
- REQ-PLAT-29B (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST read the client identifier from that revealed
  range and return its exact bytes. The Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose a
  client identifier public input. Necessity: the attestation already
  authenticates those bytes, so a circuit copy would be a second
  representation of one fact.
- REQ-PLAT-29C (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the token request's `grant_type` and
  `redirect_uri` ranges in the notarized session, including in the
  attestation the Platform Verifier checks. The Canonical Runtime MUST
  reject a transcript whose revealed serialized `grant_type` or `redirect_uri`
  value differs from the canonical form serialization of its immutable
  deployment-profile value. Neither value is a circuit
  constraint or a public proof input, and neither is a value the Consumer
  reads; the Platform Verifier compares the revealed `grant_type` itself
  under REQ-PLAT-56. Revealing them narrows the body a prover can compose
  without being observed; it does
  not by itself exclude a duplicate field, which remains ASM-PROV-07. The
  Platform Verifier enforces the disclosure: an attestation hiding either
  range does not match the profile layout of common REQ-COMMON-17A and
  REQ-COMMON-18A and fails verification.

The request carries `host: api.x.com`,
`content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and a `content-length` of the
body's own count. The Canonical Runtime also sends `accept: application/json`
and `connection: close`, which nothing verifies, and may send any other header
REQ-PLAT-56A does not forbid.

- REQ-PLAT-56A (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the token request's request line and every
  header. The Platform Verifier MUST reject a head without exactly one `host`
  naming the pinned authority and exactly one `content-type` whose value is
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, comparing names lowercased with every
  space and tab removed and `_` read as `-`, as common REQ-COMMON-39B
  normalizes, and values exactly once the optional whitespace around them is
  removed. The Platform Verifier MUST reject a head carrying `authorization`
  or any name common REQ-COMMON-39B forbids, under any spelling of the name.
  The Platform Verifier MUST ignore every other header, `content-length`
  excepted, which REQ-PLAT-56B holds to the body it frames. Necessity: common REQ-COMMON-21B fixes the media type
  because it "selects the platform's request parser", and a media type nothing
  compares is a pin in name only. The forbidden headers change what the
  platform does with the request in a way no revealed byte shows: which client
  it authenticates, which session it answers for, which bytes it parses, which
  method it runs. Any other
  header changes only what the platform answers, and a wrong answer is a
  response the verifier cannot read rather than one it can be fooled by, so
  requiring its absence would bind every prover to one HTTP library's habits
  for nothing.
- REQ-PLAT-56B (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST reject a token request whose revealed bytes carry
  other than exactly one empty line, the one that ends the head. The Platform
  Verifier MUST reject a head without exactly one `content-length`, or with
  one other than the decimal count of the body it frames, written without a
  leading zero. Necessity: the verifier takes the body to be what follows the
  head while the platform takes it to be `content-length` bytes, so where the
  two disagree the fields read are not the fields parsed; a second empty line
  is a second place a parser could end the head, and a second spelling of the
  count is a second thing to compare one spelling of.
- REQ-PLAT-56C (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST reject a head carrying a line feed not preceded by
  a carriage return, a carriage return not followed by a line feed, a line
  beginning with a space or a tab, or a line with no colon. Necessity: a
  parser accepting a bare line feed, a bare carriage return or a fold ends the
  head somewhere this one does not, moving bytes between head and body, and a
  line no colon splits is not a header field, so a parser that tolerates one
  reads a head this one cannot. Common REQ-COMMON-39A asks the first three of
  the identity request.
- REQ-PLAT-56 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST reject an X token attestation whose revealed
  `grant_type` differs from the exact ASCII bytes `authorization_code`.
  Necessity: the Canonical Runtime's comparison under REQ-PLAT-29C runs in
  software the prover chooses whether to run, and `grant_type` is the one
  revealed field that changes what X did with the request. A body sending
  `grant_type=refresh_token` while still carrying a `code`, a `redirect_uri`,
  and a digest-derived `code_verifier` is processed as a refresh: X ignores
  the fields that grant does not use, returns a fresh bearer, and every
  revealed range still checks out, so an application holding a user's refresh
  token could mint identity proofs at arbitrary addresses indefinitely from a
  single consent. The check is one byte comparison on the Consumer Chain and
  adds nothing to the Proving Circuit.
- REQ-PLAT-30A (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST commit the returned `access_token` range of the
  notarized token session as the attestation format's blinded hash
  commitment. The Implementation MUST keep the plaintext token bytes
  redacted.
- REQ-PLAT-57 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the `"access_token":"` delimiter bytes
  immediately preceding that committed range and the closing quote byte
  immediately following it. The Platform Verifier MUST reject an X token
  attestation whose committed range is not framed by exactly those revealed
  bytes. Necessity: common REQ-COMMON-18A wants a revealed anchor on every
  hidden range, and a received direction revealing nothing at all leaves the
  committed range indistinguishable from a `refresh_token` value or any
  other substring the prover chose to commit.

### 5.3 Identity request

`GET https://api.x.com/2/users/me` with no query. The request carries these
four headers, in any order, and may carry others: `authorization: Bearer
<access_token>`, `accept: application/json`, `host: api.x.com`, and
`connection: close`. The Platform Verifier compares the request line and the
`authorization` line, refuses the names common REQ-COMMON-39B forbids, and
compares no other header.

Per common §9, the identity session reveals exactly these request ranges;
the bearer value is the only committed request range, and every other
request byte is revealed:

| Range | Revealed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| request line and all request headers, except the bearer value | yes | the Platform Verifier runs the line-anchored uniqueness scan of common REQ-COMMON-39 over these bytes and frames the committed range per common REQ-COMMON-40 |
| bearer value of the `authorization` header | committed | a blinded commitment, opened only in circuit |

The two ranges account for the request's signed transcript length exactly,
with no gap and no overlap, per common REQ-COMMON-35 and REQ-COMMON-36, so
the request leaves no byte undisclosed and uncommitted.

The response direction reveals exactly these ranges; every other response
byte stays behind a range commitment of the pinned attestation format:

| Range | Revealed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `"id":"`, the `data.id` value, and its closing quote | yes | the Platform Verifier extracts the canonical `userId` from these bytes per REQ-PLAT-31 |
| `"username":"`, the `data.username` value, and its closing quote | yes | the Platform Verifier extracts the raw handle bytes from these bytes per REQ-PLAT-31 |
| everything else | no | status line, headers, display name, and every other response field |

Each revealed range carries its own full delimiter, so the value the Platform Verifier
reads is that field's value rather than a substring of a neighboring
one. Every committed range of this direction is bounded by a revealed
delimiter on each side that faces one, and by the signed transcript boundary
of common REQ-COMMON-36 at the two ends, which is the anchoring common
REQ-COMMON-18A requires.

- REQ-PLAT-59 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the full `"id":"` and `"username":"`
  delimiters, their values, and their closing quotes in the `/2/users/me`
  response. The Implementation MUST redact every other response byte behind
  a range commitment. Necessity: REQ-PLAT-31 reads both fields out of
  revealed response bytes, and a session revealing no response range at all
  leaves it nothing to read.
- REQ-PLAT-31 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST extract `id` and `username` from the revealed
  response bytes by their full `"field":"` delimiters, rejecting a transcript
  in which either delimiter matches at more than one position, per common
  REQ-COMMON-19A. Necessity: the response carries account-holder-influenced
  text, such as the display name, that can embed a lookalike field.
- REQ-PLAT-31A (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST derive the X `userId` and normalized handle from
  those same revealed `id` and `username` bytes, by the same algorithm
  REQ-PLAT-31 fixes. That derivation is the repeat common REQ-COMMON-19E
  permits, and the extraction of REQ-PLAT-31 is the authoritative one. The
  Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose a second independently supplied
  representation of either identity field.
- REQ-PLAT-32 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST assert that one private bearer value opens the
  bearer commitment of the token attestation and the `Authorization` bearer
  commitment of the `/2/users/me` attestation. The two commitment values
  differ, because common REQ-COMMON-44 draws an independent blinder for each
  notarized session.
- REQ-PLAT-32A (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Implementation MUST commit the `Authorization` bearer range of the
  notarized identity session as the attestation format's blinded hash
  commitment. The Implementation MUST keep the plaintext token bytes
  redacted. Necessity: each notarized session carries its own blinder, so the
  same bearer commits to two different values. Nothing outside a proof can
  tell that they open to one bearer, which is the reason a circuit exists at
  all.

- REQ-PLAT-32B (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST expose exactly these two X public inputs:

  | Public input | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | token bearer commitment | the commitment the Platform Verifier matches against the verified token attestation |
  | identity bearer commitment | the commitment the Platform Verifier matches against the verified `/users/me` attestation |

  The Proving Circuit MUST keep the bearer private. The Proving Circuit MUST
  NOT add an Authorization Digest, client identifier, timestamp, endpoint,
  `userId`, or handle public input.
- REQ-PLAT-32C (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST require each bearer commitment public input to
  equal the
  corresponding commitment in the attestation it verified. Necessity: without
  this the circuit could prove a link between two attestations other than the
  ones submitted.

The circuit proves exactly one thing: one hidden bearer opens both
attestations' blinded commitments. Everything else is checked where it can be
seen — the Platform Verifier binds the Authorization Digest by recomputing
the verifier under common REQ-COMMON-15A, reads the client identifier,
evidence timestamp, request method, path, and identity fields from revealed
attestation bytes, and takes each session's authority from the TLS server
identity that session's attestation authenticates. The circuit carries no
copy of any of them, because a fact that can be checked in the open does not
belong in a proof.

- REQ-PLAT-33 (upholds SP-FRESH-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST complete the request direction of X's first
  notarized token session before X's 30-second authorization-code deadline.
  The deadline ends when X has received the complete token request; receiving
  or notarizing the response, running the identity session, proving, and proof
  delivery are outside it. The Canonical Runtime MUST abandon the ceremony if it
  cannot complete that request direction in time.

## 6. GitHub ceremony

```text
identityPlatform = "github"
platformCeremonyVersion = 1
```

GitHub uses a public client with S256 PKCE. The Prover, the browser proving
part of the Canonical Runtime, performs both the token exchange and `/user`
inside browser-owned notarization sessions. The OAuth application credential
called `client_secret` by GitHub is intentionally public: it is supplied in
public configuration, sent in the token request, and revealed in its attestation.
It is not proof of the caller's authority.

This follows GitHub's [public-client guidance][GitHub-public-clients], which
includes single-page applications and recommends PKCE. The profile removes
server-side token-exchange custody; browser and service specifications own the
configuration and delivery of these public inputs.

As on X, the evidence is two attestations and one hidden bearer linking them.
The bearer-link circuit and its two commitment public inputs are unchanged.
The Platform Verifier binds the revealed `code_verifier` to the Authorization
Digest under common REQ-COMMON-15A; the circuit does not perform that binding.

### 6.1 Authorization request

`GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`:

| Order | Field | Exact value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `client_id` | configured client identifier |
| 2 | `redirect_uri` | immutable redirect URI |
| 3 | `scope` | `read:user` |
| 4 | `state` | immutable one-use OAuth state |
| 5 | `code_challenge` | PKCE challenge per common §7 |
| 6 | `code_challenge_method` | `S256` |

- REQ-PLAT-34:
  The Canonical Runtime MUST request exactly `read:user`. Necessity: GitHub
  inherits previously granted scopes for the same OAuth application, so an
  omitted scope does not yield a known grant.

### 6.2 Token exchange

`POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`, media type
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `Accept: application/json`:

| Order | Field | Exact value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `client_id` | configured client identifier |
| 2 | `code` | consumed redirect code |
| 3 | `redirect_uri` | immutable redirect URI |
| 4 | `code_verifier` | PKCE verifier per common §7 |
| 5 | `client_secret` | public OAuth application credential frozen for this ceremony; revealed |

The whole request is revealed. The table fixes field order for canonical
serialization under common §6, not to protect a hidden suffix. The credential
stays in the form body so the authenticated client identifier and the complete
request grammar have one representation; an `Authorization` header remains
forbidden by REQ-PLAT-56A.

- REQ-PLAT-61 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01, SP-BIND-01, SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Prover and Platform Verifier MUST require the complete request body to
  be the common §6 canonical form serialization of exactly the five fields in
  the table, in that order, each occurring once with a nonempty value.
  The Prover and Platform Verifier MUST reject malformed encoding, noncanonical
  spelling, an extra or duplicate field, or bytes outside that complete body.
  The Prover and Platform Verifier MUST enforce the common and profile
  charsets for `client_id`, `code`, `redirect_uri`, and `code_verifier`,
  and require `client_secret` to be printable ASCII without whitespace.
  Verification: decode each value once, apply its field constraints, serialize
  the ordered tuple with the common serializer, and compare the complete body
  byte for byte. Field names are the exact literal names in the table. Encoded
  value bytes are never reparsed as another form. A credential containing a form
  delimiter is safe only as the serializer's encoded value, not as another field.
  No `grant_type`, `refresh_token`, device-flow field, or other extension is
  admitted; the pinned endpoint receives only this authorization-code request.
  Acceptance does not depend on GitHub rejecting malformed or duplicate forms.

- REQ-PLAT-35A (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose `client_secret`, or any value derived
  from it, as a public proof input. Necessity: the complete request already
  reveals it; the circuit's only semantic public inputs remain the bearer
  commitments, not duplicated request fields.
- REQ-PLAT-35B (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the `client_id` range of the exchange request
  in the notarized session.
- REQ-PLAT-35C (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST read the client identifier from that revealed
  range and return its exact bytes. The Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose a
  client identifier public input. Necessity: the attestation already
  authenticates those bytes, so a circuit copy would be a second
  representation of one fact.
- REQ-PLAT-36 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST constrain the opened bearer range to nonempty
  printable ASCII of at most 4096 bytes. The Proving Circuit MUST verify no
  other property of the exchange response. The carriage-return and
  line-feed exclusion of common REQ-COMMON-37 applies to this range,
  because the `/user` session sends it inside a header. Necessity:
  `token_type` and the granted `scope` are response schema, and nothing on
  the Consumer Chain acts on them; the Canonical Runtime MAY check them
  locally.

### 6.3 Browser notarization

- REQ-PLAT-62 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01, SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Prover MUST perform the token and identity sessions using browser
  TLSNotary Proxy mode with the same selected notary address and the endpoints
  fixed by this profile. The Prover MUST use the client identifier, public
  application credential, and redirect URI frozen for the ceremony.
  The Prover MUST NOT delegate the token exchange to an OAuth Bridge or fetch
  replacement configuration during the ceremony. Notary routing does not select
  trusted signing keys; the Consumer Chain's Notary Service checks those.
- REQ-PLAT-37 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Prover MUST use the exact authorization code consumed from the redirect
  and the exact PKCE verifier derived for that ceremony as `code` and
  `code_verifier` in §6.2.
- REQ-PLAT-38 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover MUST correlate the bearer, its commitment opening, and the final
  token attestation with the same browser notarization session.
  The Prover MUST reject a mixed-session tuple or a partial final result.
- REQ-PLAT-55 (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST treat the bearer commitment opening as private
  witness material for the Proving Circuit.
  The Canonical Runtime MUST NOT include that opening in a Submission, log,
  or published artifact. Necessity: publishing the opening defeats the
  commitment's protection against guessing the bearer.

Session setup and proof preparation may overlap. The token response's parsed
bearer can feed `/user` before the final token attestation arrives. That bearer
and any early witness material are provisional; proof delivery waits for both
final, structurally checked and correlated attestations. Neither session's
failure can be turned into a partial successful ceremony.

- REQ-PLAT-43B:
  The Prover MUST reject redirects from the token endpoint. Necessity: a
  followed redirect would notarize a session other than the pinned endpoint.

### 6.4 Disclosure and verification

Prover obtains the token attestation from its browser notarization session.
The complete request, including `client_secret`, is one revealed range. There
is no committed request suffix. The response still commits the bearer and
reveals its framing; all other response bytes retain their existing layout.

The browser keeps the bearer and commitment openings as private witness
material under REQ-PLAT-55. The final proof carries the original signed
attestation bytes, not a separately supplied copy of the public credential.
The Notary Service verifies this attestation on the Consumer Chain, exactly
as it verifies the `/user` attestation.

| Range | Revealed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `client_id` | yes | the Platform Verifier reads and returns it; the Canonical Runtime checks its profile |
| `code` | yes | the Canonical Runtime compares it to the code it consumed |
| `redirect_uri` | yes | the Canonical Runtime compares its immutable profile |
| `code_verifier` | yes | the Platform Verifier recomputes it from the digest and `authorizationNonce` per common REQ-COMMON-15A |
| `"access_token":"` and the closing quote immediately around the bearer value | yes | anchor the committed bearer range as that field's value, per common REQ-COMMON-18A |
| bearer range | committed | a blinded commitment, opened only in circuit to link this attestation to `/user` |
| attestation timestamp | not a range | the attestation's own signed creation time, which derives the authenticated validity ceiling per §2.2 |
| token endpoint authority | not a range | the Notary Service authenticated the TLS server identity, and the Platform Verifier compares the attested authority against its pinned constant per common REQ-COMMON-21A |
| the request line and every request header | yes | the Platform Verifier compares the method and path with its profile constants, requires `host` and the media type that selects the parser the platform applied to the body rows beneath this one (common REQ-COMMON-21B), and refuses the headers REQ-PLAT-56A forbids |
| `client_secret` | yes | public application credential; complete form validation under REQ-PLAT-61 leaves no hidden request field |
| everything else | no | the response status line and headers, `scope`, `token_type`, other response fields |

Every unrevealed range stays behind the pinned attestation format's range
commitment. The delimiter row is what anchors the committed bearer range in
the received direction, which would otherwise carry no revealed byte and
leave that range indistinguishable from a `refresh_token` value. Neither the
authority nor the attestation timestamp is a transcript range at all. The
authority reaches the Platform Verifier
as the TLS server identity the Notary Service authenticated under common
REQ-COMMON-21, carried in the attested data, because the
transcript holds the authority only in a `Host` header, and that header is
prover-composed text that says nothing about which server answered. Revealing
it, as REQ-PLAT-56A now requires, does not make it the authority: it is one
of the two headers the verifier holds to a pinned value, while the
authority continues to reach the verifier as the authenticated TLS server
identity. The timestamp is the signed creation time of the attested
data itself, which is why common REQ-COMMON-25 can forbid inferring it from a
response header. Revealing more than this would widen exposure without adding
a check -- the full request is checked, while the undisclosed response fields
are platform-owned bytes that no verifier reads.

The exchange request carries `host: github.com` and the pinned media type.
Prover also sends `accept: application/json` and `connection: close`, which
nothing verifies. REQ-PLAT-56B holds Content-Length to the complete revealed
body; common REQ-COMMON-18A holds the request range to the signed layout.

- REQ-PLAT-43D (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover and Platform Verifier MUST require the request direction to be
  one fully revealed range covering its complete signed length, without hidden,
  omitted, or overlapping bytes.
  The Prover MUST reveal no response range outside the rows marked `yes`
  above. The Prover MUST commit the bearer range rather than reveal it.
  REQ-PLAT-56A, REQ-PLAT-56B, REQ-PLAT-56C and REQ-PLAT-61 apply to this
  request. The previous hidden-`client_secret` request layout is not accepted.
- REQ-PLAT-58 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover MUST reveal the `"access_token":"` delimiter
  bytes immediately preceding that committed range and the closing quote byte
  immediately following it. The Platform Verifier MUST reject a
  token-exchange attestation whose committed range is not framed by exactly
  those revealed bytes. Necessity: the exchange response reveals no other
  byte, so without this anchor nothing distinguishes the committed range from
  a `refresh_token` value, and the revealed bound common REQ-COMMON-18A wants
  on every hidden range is absent.
- REQ-PLAT-43E (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose the bearer, or any value from which the
  bearer can be recovered, as a public proof input. The bearer commitments
  are public inputs under REQ-PLAT-52A; they reveal nothing about
  the bearer and are what ties the circuit to the two verified attestations.

- REQ-PLAT-44 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover MUST validate each final token attestation's exact structure,
  canonical encoding, profile authority/method/path, request bindings, and
  commitment/opening correlation before proof delivery. Neither Prover nor
  Application performs local notary-signature verification. Signature-format
  checks do not establish authenticity; the Consumer Chain's Notary Service
  authenticates the original signed bytes under common REQ-COMMON-33 and
  REQ-COMMON-33A. This omits early cryptographic forgery detection, not ledger
  verification.
- REQ-PLAT-45 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover MUST obtain an attestation carrying the selected notary's
  signature and revealing the token request's method and path.
  The Platform Verifier MUST compare the attested authority and the revealed
  method and path with this profile under common REQ-COMMON-21A.

- REQ-PLAT-46 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST require the disclosed serialized `code` value to
  equal the canonical form serialization of the code it consumed at redirect
  ingress, byte for byte.
- REQ-PLAT-47 (upholds SP-CLIENT-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST require the disclosed `client_id` to equal its
  configured client. Common REQ-COMMON-16B makes those bytes identical before
  and after form serialization.
- REQ-PLAT-48 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST require the disclosed `code_verifier` to equal the
  verifier it derived. Its base64url alphabet is byte-identical under form
  serialization.
- REQ-PLAT-48A (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST require the disclosed serialized `redirect_uri`
  value to equal the canonical form serialization of its immutable
  deployment-profile value.
- REQ-PLAT-49 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover MUST require the token-response bearer, under its same-session
  commitment opening, to open the token attestation's bearer commitment.
- REQ-PLAT-50 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Prover MUST fail the ceremony without proof delivery when any check in
  REQ-PLAT-38 or REQ-PLAT-44 through REQ-PLAT-49 fails.
  The Prover MUST discard provisional witness/proof material and stop pending
  dependent work on that failure. A failure observed before `/user` starts
  prevents it; a later failure does not undo an already sent request.
  A structurally valid forged signature alone is not a browser rejection;
  authoritative notary verification rejects it downstream.

Full disclosure is not sufficient by itself: REQ-PLAT-61 verifies the complete
form grammar instead of matching arbitrary substrings. GitHub therefore has no
hidden request-field assumption and no dependency on ASM-PROV-07's
platform-side duplicate-field rejection. TLS authority, PKCE, one-use code,
notary authenticity, and bearer-link verification remain required.

### 6.5 Identity request

`GET https://api.github.com/user` with no query. The request carries these
six headers, in any order, and may carry others:
`authorization: Bearer <access_token>`, `accept: application/vnd.github+json`,
`x-github-api-version: 2022-11-28`, `host: api.github.com`,
`connection: close`, and a `user-agent` of the Canonical Runtime's choosing,
which GitHub requires of every API request and answers `403` without. The
Platform Verifier compares the request line and the `authorization` line,
refuses the names common REQ-COMMON-39B forbids, and compares no other
header.

Per common §9, the identity session reveals exactly these request ranges;
the bearer value is the only committed request range, and every other
request byte is revealed:

| Range | Revealed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| request line and all request headers, except the bearer value | yes | the Platform Verifier runs the line-anchored uniqueness scan of common REQ-COMMON-39 over these bytes and frames the committed range per common REQ-COMMON-40 |
| bearer value of the `authorization` header | committed | a blinded commitment, opened only in circuit |

The two ranges account for the request's signed transcript length exactly,
with no gap and no overlap, per common REQ-COMMON-35 and REQ-COMMON-36, so
the request leaves no byte undisclosed and uncommitted.

The response direction reveals exactly these ranges; every other response
byte stays behind a range commitment of the pinned attestation format:

| Range | Revealed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `"id":`, the `id` integer token, and the structural byte after it, which is `,` or `}` | yes | the Platform Verifier extracts the canonical `userId` from these bytes per REQ-PLAT-51 |
| `"login":"`, the `login` value, and its closing quote | yes | the Platform Verifier extracts the raw handle bytes from these bytes per REQ-PLAT-51 |
| everything else | no | status line, headers, and every other response field |

Each revealed range carries its own full delimiter, so the value the Platform Verifier
reads is that field's value rather than a substring of a neighboring
one. Every committed range of this direction is bounded by a revealed
delimiter on each side that faces one, and by the signed transcript boundary
of common REQ-COMMON-36 at the two ends, which is the anchoring common
REQ-COMMON-18A requires.

- REQ-PLAT-60 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Implementation MUST reveal the full `"id":` delimiter, its integer
  token, and the structural byte after it, together with the full
  `"login":"` delimiter, its value, and its closing quote, in the `/user`
  response. The Implementation MUST keep the JSON whitespace GitHub puts
  inside either member in the revealed range, per common REQ-COMMON-19F. The
  Implementation MUST redact every other response byte behind a range
  commitment. Necessity: REQ-PLAT-51 reads both fields out of
  revealed response bytes, and a session revealing no response range at all
  leaves it nothing to read.
- REQ-PLAT-51 (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST extract `id` and `login` from the revealed
  response bytes by their full field delimiters, rejecting a transcript in
  which either delimiter matches at more than one position, per common
  REQ-COMMON-19A. The Platform Verifier MUST reject a noncanonical `id`
  encoding. The GitHub profile fixes the structural byte following the
  `id` integer token, which common REQ-COMMON-19D leaves to the profile, as
  `,` or `}` and no other byte, judged after the removal common
  REQ-COMMON-19F fixes. The Platform Verifier MUST reject any other
  following byte. Necessity: the terminator is what proves the revealed digits
  are the whole number rather than a prefix of a longer one, and JSON member
  order does not guarantee which of the two closes it.
- REQ-PLAT-51A (upholds SP-BIND-01):
  The Canonical Runtime MUST derive the GitHub `userId` and normalized handle
  from those same revealed `id` and `login` bytes, by the same algorithm
  REQ-PLAT-51 fixes. That derivation is the repeat common REQ-COMMON-19E
  permits, and the extraction of REQ-PLAT-51 is the authoritative one. The
  Proving Circuit MUST NOT expose a second independently supplied
  representation of either identity field.
- REQ-PLAT-52 (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST assert that one private bearer value opens the
  bearer commitment of the token-exchange attestation and the
  `Authorization` bearer commitment of the `/user` attestation. The Platform Verifier MUST
  compare the method and path revealed in each attestation, and
  the authority each attestation authenticates, with the GitHub profile.

- REQ-PLAT-52A (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Proving Circuit MUST expose exactly these two GitHub public inputs:

  | Public input | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | token-exchange bearer commitment | the commitment the Platform Verifier matches against the verified token-exchange attestation |
  | identity bearer commitment | the commitment the Platform Verifier matches against the verified `/user` attestation |

  The Proving Circuit MUST NOT add an Authorization Digest, client identifier,
  timestamp, endpoint, `userId`, or handle public input. Necessity: the digest
  is bound by the Platform Verifier under common REQ-COMMON-15A, and the rest
  are revealed bytes it reads directly, so a circuit copy would be a second
  representation of a fact that already has one.
- REQ-PLAT-52B (upholds SP-EXCHANGE-01):
  The Platform Verifier MUST require each bearer commitment public input to
  equal the
  corresponding commitment in the attestation it verified. Necessity: without
  this the circuit could prove a link between two attestations other than the
  ones submitted.

Changing the pinned API version requires a new Platform Ceremony Version; it
is not mutable configuration. The granted scope is no proof property at all:
REQ-PLAT-36 leaves the exchange response unverified beyond the opened bearer
range, and the Canonical Runtime's local reading of `scope` and `token_type`
binds nothing on the Consumer Chain. The bearer is never disclosed by the
proof.

- REQ-PLAT-53:
  The Canonical Runtime MUST start a fresh ceremony when GitHub consumed the
  code but usable evidence was lost. Necessity: browser token exchange remains
  a single-use, non-recoverable step; no Bridge result or replay exists.

## 7. Adding an identity platform

The Platform Profile for a new platform MUST define a stable platform
identifier and immutable
user-ID namespace; canonical handle normalization and authenticated
observation ordering; client portability or a bounded client family; exact
authorization and redirect transport; every authenticated request and
response field with its provenance; how the Authorization Digest is carried
through that platform's authorization; its authenticated client-binding source; an
authenticated proof-validity rule and parameter keys; its trust-root lifecycle;
browser and deployment data exposure, retry, interruption, and withholding
behavior; and conformance vectors.

## 8. Conformance

Roles: Canonical Runtime (including Prover), Proving Circuit,
Platform Verifier, Notary Service, Consumer.

- TEST-PLAT-01 (exercises REQ-PLAT-10, REQ-PLAT-18):
  The §3.1 nonce vector reproduces exactly, and a token carrying another nonce
  is rejected.
- TEST-PLAT-02 (exercises REQ-PLAT-04, REQ-PLAT-05, REQ-PLAT-06, REQ-PLAT-07, REQ-PLAT-08):
  The §2.1 identifier vectors reproduce, and each listed malformed identifier
  is rejected.
- TEST-PLAT-03 (exercises REQ-PLAT-11, REQ-PLAT-12):
  A Google authorization request not using the exact direct-ID-token fragment
  profile is rejected. A nonempty query, mixed query/fragment response, or
  fragment carrying duplicate `state`, both `id_token` and `error`, `code`, or
  `access_token` is rejected.
- TEST-PLAT-04 (exercises REQ-PLAT-13, REQ-PLAT-14):
  A fragment whose `state` has no unique live local ceremony, and an ID Token
  whose `nonce` is not the constructed digest, are rejected. No backend state
  lookup occurs.
- TEST-PLAT-05 (exercises REQ-PLAT-15):
  A Google response carrying an authorization code or access token is rejected,
  and the deployment contains no Google exchange route or client secret.
  Verification: inspection of emitted artifacts.
- TEST-PLAT-06 (exercises REQ-COMMON-19D, REQ-PLAT-16, REQ-PLAT-16A, REQ-PLAT-16B, REQ-PLAT-17, REQ-PLAT-19, REQ-PLAT-19A, REQ-PLAT-20, REQ-PLAT-21, REQ-PLAT-23):
  A token with a foreign issuer, foreign audience, `email_verified: false`, a
  quoted or non-boolean `email_verified`, a quoted, negative, fractional,
  exponent, leading-zero, or overflowing `exp`, or an untrusted signing
  modulus is rejected in each case. A token signed
  under any other algorithm or key fails the fixed verification relation.
  Header, payload, signature, or public-output substitution is rejected. A
  cryptographically valid proof under an inactive signing modulus passes
  circuit verification but is rejected by the Platform Verifier. An Submission
  whose supplied `aud` bytes do not hash to the audience public input is
  rejected, and an accepted one returns those exact bytes as the client
  identifier.
- TEST-PLAT-07 (exercises REQ-PLAT-22, REQ-PLAT-09, REQ-PLAT-09A):
  A proof at or after `proofValidUntil`, and a token-attestation creation time
  more than `maxFutureAttestationSkew` ahead of Block Time, are rejected. An
  X or GitHub identity-attestation timestamp changes neither
  `metadataObservedAt` nor `proofValidUntil`; Google uses its signed `exp`
  for both values.
- TEST-PLAT-08 (exercises REQ-PLAT-24):
  The trusted modulus set contains every modulus currently published at
  Google's JWKS endpoint, and every corresponding exponent is 65537.
- TEST-PLAT-09 (exercises REQ-PLAT-29, REQ-PLAT-46):
  A transcript whose disclosed `code` differs from the code consumed at
  redirect ingress is rejected on X and on GitHub. A code containing a
  form-reserved byte matches only its canonical serialized value range, never
  the unencoded bytes or a noncanonical alternative.
- TEST-PLAT-09A (exercises REQ-PLAT-29A, REQ-PLAT-29B):
  An X attestation that does not reveal the token request's `client_id` is
  rejected; a proof exposing a client identifier public input is rejected; and
  the identifier the Platform Verifier returns equals the revealed bytes.
- TEST-PLAT-09B (exercises REQ-PLAT-30A, REQ-PLAT-32A):
  An X transcript that reveals plaintext `access_token` bytes in either
  session, or omits the bearer hash commitment, is rejected.
- TEST-PLAT-09C (exercises REQ-PLAT-29C, REQ-PLAT-56, REQ-PLAT-56A, REQ-PLAT-56B, REQ-PLAT-56C):
  The Platform Verifier rejects an X attestation that hides the `grant_type`
  or `redirect_uri` range, and the Canonical Runtime rejects a revealed value
  differing from the canonical form serialization of its deployment profile.
  A redirect URI containing `:` and `/` passes in that encoded form and fails
  as literal unencoded bytes. The Platform Verifier rejects an
  attestation whose revealed `grant_type` is `refresh_token`, and one whose
  `grant_type` differs from `authorization_code` in any byte, even when every
  other revealed range and the proof itself check out. The Platform Verifier
  accepts a token request whose headers arrive in another order, or carry a
  header the profile does not name, and one whose required names are spelled
  in another letter case, with `_` for `-`, or padded before the colon; it
  rejects a head missing `host` or `content-type`, carrying either twice, or
  carrying `authorization`, `cookie`, `content-encoding`, `transfer-encoding`
  or a method-override name under any spelling; it rejects a head with no
  empty line or a second one, with no `content-length` or two, or with a
  count that is not the body's length, is not decimal digits, or carries a
  leading zero, and accepts the count wherever it sits in the head; and it
  rejects a head carrying a bare line feed, a bare carriage return, an
  obsolete line fold, or a line with no colon.
- TEST-PLAT-10 (exercises REQ-PLAT-30, REQ-PLAT-31, REQ-PLAT-32, REQ-PLAT-36, REQ-PLAT-51, REQ-PLAT-52):
  An opened bearer range that is empty, over 4096 bytes, or outside printable
  ASCII fails to prove; a revealed identity response missing `id` or the
  handle field is rejected; and a proof whose two attestations commit
  different bearers is rejected. No proof statement covers `token_type` or the
  granted scope.
- TEST-PLAT-11 (exercises REQ-PLAT-33):
  The complete request direction of X's first notarized session reaches X
  before the authorization-code deadline in the success case; delaying its
  completion past the deadline abandons the ceremony, while delaying only the
  response or later proof work does not trigger that deadline.
- TEST-PLAT-12 (exercises REQ-PLAT-34, REQ-PLAT-35A, REQ-PLAT-35B, REQ-PLAT-35C, REQ-PLAT-61):
  Scope other than `read:user` rejects locally. The complete token request
  reveals the public credential and client ID, while the circuit adds neither
  as a public input. The Platform Verifier returns the revealed client ID.
  The canonical five-field form passes; missing, empty, additional, duplicate,
  reordered, malformed, or noncanonical fields fail downstream even if the
  platform were to accept them. Encoded duplicate names cannot evade the
  exact name/serialization check. A credential with encoded delimiters remains
  one value and passes; raw delimiters creating more fields fail. Refresh or
  device-grant fields fail. All accepted lengths cover the complete body.
- TEST-PLAT-13 (exercises REQ-PLAT-37, REQ-PLAT-38, REQ-PLAT-62):
  Prover sends the frozen client/credential/redirect and ceremony code/verifier
  through its token Proxy session, using the same selected notary as identity.
  No Bridge token request or configuration refetch occurs. Both session setups
  and proof preparation may overlap; `/user` waits for a parsed bearer but
  not necessarily the final token attestation. A mixed-session tuple or partial
  final result fails; both final attestations are required for delivery.
  Qualification uses the matched browser WASM and real Proxy notary for both
  GitHub endpoints, not only mocks or a native MPC token session.
- TEST-PLAT-14 (exercises REQ-PLAT-43B, REQ-PLAT-43D, REQ-PLAT-43E, REQ-PLAT-56A, REQ-PLAT-56B, REQ-PLAT-56C, REQ-PLAT-61):
  A redirected token exchange rejects in Prover. Downstream layout validation
  rejects a hidden request suffix, omitted request bytes, gaps, overlaps,
  response disclosures outside the profile, or a revealed bearer. The
  head vectors of TEST-PLAT-09C run on this request too: unlisted headers pass,
  forbidden or missing required headers reject, and Content-Length matches
  the complete revealed body. The previous hidden-secret layout fails.
- TEST-PLAT-15 (exercises REQ-PLAT-44, REQ-PLAT-45, REQ-PLAT-46, REQ-PLAT-47, REQ-PLAT-48, REQ-PLAT-48A, REQ-PLAT-49, REQ-PLAT-50):
  Malformed canonical attestation bytes, authority/method/path, request
  bindings, signature shape, or bearer/opening correlation fail in Prover.
  Failure before identity HTTP prevents it. Failure after provisional bearer
  use stops remaining work and discards any speculative proof; it never
  delivers partial evidence. A structurally valid forged signature preserving
  all checked correlations has no local cryptographic rejection, but fails
  trusted-notary verification downstream. Application structural acceptance
  does not establish signature authenticity.
- TEST-PLAT-15A (exercises REQ-PLAT-52, REQ-PLAT-52A, REQ-PLAT-52B):
  A GitHub proof whose bearer commitment public input differs from the
  commitment in either submitted attestation is rejected; substituting one
  attestation for another from a different ceremony is rejected; and the
  proof carries no bearer, code, verifier, redirect URI, or added identity,
  time, client, or endpoint public input.
- TEST-PLAT-15B (exercises REQ-PLAT-32B, REQ-PLAT-32C):
  An X proof whose bearer commitment public input differs from the commitment
  in the submitted attestation is rejected, and a proof carrying a client
  identifier, timestamp, endpoint, `userId`, or handle public input is
  rejected.
- TEST-PLAT-16 (exercises REQ-PLAT-53):
  A ceremony whose exchange response was lost restarts from authorization.
- TEST-PLAT-17 (exercises REQ-PLAT-01, REQ-PLAT-01A, REQ-PLAT-01B, REQ-PLAT-02, REQ-PLAT-03):
  The launch profile pairs are exactly `("google", 1)`, `("x", 1)`, and
  `("github", 1)`; a suffixed platform string is not one of those profiles. A
  live ceremony that substitutes a newer profile is rejected, an unlisted
  profile is ineligible, and the profile identifies the same proof statement
  and semantic public inputs across two chains using different conforming
  verifier artifacts. A destination chain does not support the pair without a
  conforming artifact or, for a TLSNotary profile, a compatible Notary Service.
  No local identity field originates outside proof public inputs and the exact
  revealed attestation bytes carried by its Submission. Only the Consumer's
  acceptance of that exact Submission makes the claim authoritative.
- TEST-PLAT-17A (exercises REQ-PLAT-03, REQ-PLAT-31A, REQ-PLAT-51A):
  Pair authenticated X or GitHub identity-response bytes for account B with a
  detached `userId`, handle, or metadata value for account A. The Canonical Runtime
  rejects the extra representation; without it, the Canonical Runtime and the
  Platform Verifier both derive account B byte for byte. Replacing the proof,
  attestation, platform, or version after deriving the local identity fields
  discards them and requires rederivation from the replacement Submission.
- TEST-PLAT-18 (exercises REQ-PLAT-25, REQ-PLAT-26, REQ-PLAT-27, REQ-PLAT-28, REQ-PLAT-28A):
  Launch uses Proxy mode, rejects application or request selection of Browser
  MPC, uses no application-controlled platform egress, and carries no partial
  transcript state into a retry. A nonempty fragment, mixed query/fragment
  response, or redirect carrying two `code` fields, two `state` fields, both
  `code` and `error`, or a malformed field is rejected
  before any token request starts, as is a redirect whose `state` matches no
  live local ceremony or a ceremony already consumed.
- TEST-PLAT-19 (exercises REQ-COMMON-32; supports ASM-PROV-07):
  Recurring integration probes send each profile-listed X token
  request field twice, in both orders and using both literal and percent-encoded
  equivalent field names, and send the otherwise valid request under alternate
  media types. The production endpoint rejects every probe and issues no
  bearer.
- TEST-PLAT-21 (exercises REQ-PLAT-38, REQ-PLAT-49, REQ-PLAT-55):
  A same-session bearer opening opens the token attestation commitment; a
  missing, mismatched, or other-session opening fails. The opening remains
  browser witness material and is absent from Submissions and published
  artifacts. There is no Bridge response whose fields supply it.
- TEST-PLAT-22 (exercises REQ-PLAT-57, REQ-PLAT-58, REQ-PLAT-59, REQ-PLAT-60):
  An X token attestation and a GitHub token-exchange attestation whose
  committed bearer range is not framed by the revealed `"access_token":"`
  delimiter and closing quote are each rejected, including one committing a
  `refresh_token` value instead; and an X `/2/users/me` or GitHub `/user`
  attestation revealing no `id`, `username`, or `login` range, or revealing
  a value without its full delimiter, is rejected.

## 9. Security Considerations

This document enforces SP-BIND-01, SP-CLIENT-01, SP-EXCHANGE-01, and
SP-FRESH-01 for the launch platforms, under the assumptions of
[common §3](ceremony-common.md#3-assumptions).

Google is the only platform whose evidence is a bearer artifact: an ID Token
is complete evidence to whoever holds it. Its delivery is therefore
trust-bearing, and ASM-PROV-01 carries that weight. X and GitHub deliver an
authorization code, which is not evidence until redeemed, so a code alone
grants nothing.

X and GitHub are public clients. GitHub's application credential is a
required request field, not a confidential authenticator of the presenter.
Possession of that credential alone grants neither a user's bearer token nor
a valid identity proof. Redemption still requires a usable code and its PKCE
verifier; the registered redirect destinations and their code remain
trust-bearing for the local ceremony. Compromise of a browser holding those
inputs defeats their confidentiality.

Public application credentials can be reused outside this ceremony, including
for app-authenticated API traffic GitHub permits. This accepts an unquantified
availability risk from third-party abuse or platform suspension. The protocol
does not claim abuse isolation, and renaming the public configuration field
provides no confidentiality. This changes neither the downstream proof checks
nor their trust roots.

SP-BIND-01 rests on the platform enforcing the PKCE challenge match
(ASM-PROV-02) for X and GitHub, and on Google reflecting the requested nonce
into a signed token (ASM-PROV-05). ASM-PROV-02 is a live dependency on
platform behavior rather than a proven property. The Implementation claiming
conformance MUST run a recurring check that each platform still rejects a
mismatched `code_verifier`.

X still relies on ASM-PROV-07 for decoded-form uniqueness and uses
TEST-PLAT-19's recurring probes. GitHub instead rejects noncanonical or extra
fields over its fully revealed request under REQ-PLAT-61; it no longer relies
on GitHub rejecting duplicate fields. Both still assume the platform honors
the canonical request, PKCE, and one-use authorization-code semantics.

The Prover can withhold work or supply malformed evidence. Local request and
commitment checks detect structural substitution, not a well-formed forged
notary signature; the Consumer Chain's Notary Service remains authoritative.
A proof built outside the Canonical Runtime still faces those downstream
checks and the Transaction Author rule in
[common §12](ceremony-common.md#12-security-considerations).
Proxy notarization exposes session traffic to the notary; the protocol does
not promise bearer confidentiality from that notary. The bearer remains
hidden from the published proof by the two commitments and link circuit.

The notary key is a trust root for X and GitHub evidence. Its compromise
mints fresh evidence until the key is removed, and does not revoke authority
already committed.

Google has no server-side token exchange. Its signed ID Token reaches the
redirect fragment, is cleared before
other work, and is bound to the local ceremony by `state`, signed `nonce`, and
signed `aud`. A deployment backend can withhold the static redirect document
but cannot substitute an ID Token through a server exchange that does not
exist.

Google's JWKS rotation makes the trusted modulus set a liveness dependency
(REQ-PLAT-24): every Google ceremony fails closed while Google signs with an
untrusted modulus.
