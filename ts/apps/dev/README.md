# @libid/dev

Local application for testing real ceremonies with the OAuth Bridge, notary and
CCDP distribution. It uses a synthetic ledger fixture and submits no transactions.

## Run

Use the workspace's Node and pnpm setup, plus Docker with Compose. Docker Desktop
on macOS needs amd64 emulation for the notary image. No host Rust toolchain or
local certificates are needed.

From the TypeScript workspace:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open **http://localhost:4691**. The command builds dependencies and CCDP, starts
Docker services, waits for Bridge readiness, then starts the frontend. The first
build takes longer; later launches reuse cached downloads and container layers.
Ctrl-C stops the app and that checkout's containers.

| Service | Local URL |
|---|---|
| Application | http://localhost:4691 |
| OAuth Bridge | http://localhost:4682 |
| CCDP | http://localhost:4683 |
| Notary HTTP/WebSocket | http://localhost:4687 |

These are separate browser origins. Ports are fixed and services bind to loopback.

## Configure and develop

Edit configuration directly where it is used:

- [compose.yaml](compose.yaml): services.
- [bridge-config.toml](bridge-config.toml): Bridge configuration and development OAuth credentials.
- [src/app.ts](src/app.ts): Bridge/CCDP URLs and the local ledger/notary fixture.
- [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts): frontend port.

The setup includes shared development OAuth credentials and a public development
notary signing key; no environment file is needed. Bridge publishes the GitHub
`clientCredential` from its platform configuration. OAuth registrations must use
**`http://localhost:4682/auth/callback`**. To connect another application, add its
exact origin to `allowed_app_origins` in `bridge-config.toml`.

Frontend edits reload through Vite. After changing ceremony or popup source,
run this in another terminal while `pnpm dev` stays running:

```sh
pnpm dev:ccdp
```

It rebuilds the packages and static distribution, then recreates only CCDP.
Bridge, notary and the app stay running; no Docker images are built. Refresh
the app and start a fresh ceremony to use updated Prover/Prefetch code.
Bridge caches Callback for up to five minutes, so restart `pnpm dev` after
Callback changes to apply them immediately. Also restart after changing service
configuration or dependency images; unchanged Bridge builds reuse Docker layers.

To run services and frontend separately:

```sh
pnpm dev:services
# Another terminal:
pnpm dev:app
```

Choose a platform and complete provider consent. Multiple ceremonies can run at
once, including for the same platform. Each history row has its own status and
Close button. Success and denial close only that run’s popup automatically;
failed popups remain open for DevTools inspection and can be closed with the same
button while its connection remains usable. The Close control disappears when
the connection ends. Reported closure marks the run Interrupted; detected
transport failure reports its error. With a native-anchor launch, Close becomes
available after the popup authenticates and can be controlled.
Results are available in `window.results`, a Map keyed by each row's
`data-ceremony-id`. See the [manual qualification checkpoints](../../packages/ceremony/docs/testing.md#manual-consent-and-device-checks); the displayed outcomes alone do not establish cryptographic verification.

## Checks

```sh
pnpm --filter @libid/dev typecheck
pnpm --filter @libid/dev... build
pnpm --filter @libid/dev test:e2e
```

The browser tests use port 4692 and cover frontend behavior with intercepted
responses. Real OAuth and proving checks are documented in the
[ceremony qualification guide](../../packages/ceremony/docs/qualification.md).

Run history shows core operation durations from their occurrence timestamps, plus
total ceremony time. The status uses the package’s stage
projection. Timings freeze at the terminal outcome and clear on page reload;
interrupted operations are marked, and overlapping durations are not added together.

When isolation fallback occurs, **Prover fallback** shows navigation through Prover
readiness, using `prover-fallback` and `prover.started` occurrence timestamps. It
excludes work before navigation and does not measure the difference from a run
without fallback. Direct runs have no fallback row.
