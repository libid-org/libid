# libID

libID is a trust-minimized identity system that bridges identities from
OAuth-enabled platforms to blockchains. Initial integrations include Google,
X, and GitHub, but the system is designed to support any OAuth-based platform.
It currently supports EVM-compatible chains.

The initial integrations were chosen for both product relevance and technical
coverage. Google, X, and GitHub each represent a materially different
OAuth/OIDC model. Together they cover most of the variability relevant to
libID and demonstrate that secure identity bridging is feasible across these
models. Their security designs are documented in the
[Google](specs/platform-ceremonies.md#3-google-oidc-ceremony),
[X](specs/platform-ceremonies.md#5-x-ceremony), and
[GitHub](specs/platform-ceremonies.md#6-github-ceremony) ceremony profiles.

Identity bridging lets **an existing user handle stand in for an onchain
address**, similar to an onchain naming service.

A central motivation is reach: **a user can transact with anyone who already
has an account on a supported platform, even before the recipient links a
wallet**. Once its owner proves control of the account and links a wallet, the
value is automatically claimable without a separate claim action by either the
sender or the recipient.

The core is built bottom-up using a spec-driven approach and includes the tools
needed to make the system accessible, self-hostable, and reusable by
application developers, wallet providers, and other integrators without
introducing a central point of failure.

Beyond identity bridging, libID seeks closer collaboration with online
platforms through integrations that benefit both platforms and their users.
These integrations will **enable users to prove their activity and transact
freely on those platforms**, exercising their essential human right to
transact.

## In this repository

Besides the protocol specifications under [`specs/`](specs/), this repo
carries the browser claim library and the integration harness:

- [`ts/packages/claim`](ts/packages/claim) — **`@libid/claim`**, the browser
  library for the OAuth handle-claim flows. GitHub (backend-driven MPC-TLS),
  X (in-browser TLSNotary ProxyMode + a Noir/UltraHonk proof), and Google
  (a SNARK over the OIDC id_token). Each flow opens the consent popup,
  proves control of the account, and returns bind-ready proof bytes made
  out to the holder address; encoding/submission/resolution helpers come
  from [`@libid/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@libid/contracts).
  Framework-free (no React), wallet-product-free (a unit test enforces it).
- [`ts/apps/demo`](ts/apps/demo) — a buttons-only vite demo consuming the
  library: connect a wallet (or a dev key), claim a handle, resolve it.
- [`harness/`](harness) — the integration harness: a docker-compose stack
  (anvil + deterministic contract deploy + released notary and
  libid-server-rs images) plus asset staging and one `boot.sh` for a
  real, manual end-to-end claim. See [`harness/README.md`](harness/README.md).
